# Slavic Nation Club | RFL

A single-page website for the Slavic Nation Club Roblox RFL community — dark navy / red / white theme, glassmorphism cards, animated particle background, and a page for every member nation with a searchable, sortable squad table.

## 📁 Structure

```
.
├── index.html       ← the entire site (HTML + CSS + JS in one file)
├── logo-snc.png      ← placeholder club logo (replace with your own)
├── logo-rfl.png      ← placeholder league logo (replace with your own)
├── favicon.png       ← browser tab icon
├── .nojekyll         ← tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing
└── README.md
```

All files sit in the **root** of the repository — this matters for GitHub Pages, don't nest them in a subfolder.

## 🚀 Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and push these files to it (or upload them via "Add file → Upload files").
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, choose the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder, then **Save**.
4. Wait a minute — your site will be live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`.

## 🖼️ Replace the logos

The two logos are placeholders. To use your real ones:

1. Upload your PNG/SVG files to the repository root (keep them roughly square, transparent background works best).
2. Name them `logo-snc.png` and `logo-rfl.png` (overwriting the placeholders) — or keep your own names and update the three `<img src="...">` references in `index.html` (loading screen, top nav, and hero section).
3. For the favicon, replace `favicon.png` (square, at least 64×64).

## 👥 Fill in the squads

All player data lives in one place near the bottom of `index.html`, inside the `COUNTRIES` array:

```js
const COUNTRIES = [
  { code:"pl", flag:"🇵🇱", name:"Poland",
    desc:"Disciplined and <b>tactically sharp</b>...",
    players: [
      { num: 9, name: "Ivan Petrov", pos: "Forward", age: 19, apps: 12, goals: 8 },
      { num: 4, name: "Marek Kowalski", pos: "Defender", age: 21, apps: 10, goals: 1 },
    ]
  },
  ...
];
```

Just add objects to the `players` array for each country — the squad table (with search + sorting) fills itself automatically. Leave `players: []` empty for a country until you're ready to add its roster.

## ✏️ Editing text

- **Hero title / tagline** — in the `<section id="page-home">` block, inside `.hero`.
- **About Club text** — inside `.about-card`.
- **Country descriptions** — the `desc` field per country in the `COUNTRIES` array (use `<b>...</b>` for bold words).

## 🎨 Customizing colors

All colors are CSS variables at the top of the `<style>` block:

```css
--navy-deep:#060a1a;
--navy:#0b1330;
--red:#e0202a;
--red-glow:#ff3c46;
--gold:#c9a24a;
--white:#f2f4fa;
```

Change these and the whole site updates.

## ⚙️ No build step needed

This is a plain static HTML/CSS/JS site — no npm, no build tools. Just open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally, or push to GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel as-is.
